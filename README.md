# SensintShapes? ðŸ˜¶

## Idea
The idea is to build self-contained 3D-printed objects, such as spheres and cubes, and embed the illusion of friction in them. Ideally, we should be able to change the vibration parameters using Bluetooth.

## Components
1. [Actuator: VG1040003D](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/vybronics-inc/VG1040003D/10285886). It is the closest replacement to the one used in vARitouch.
2. [IMU: BNO085](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4754)
3. [Microcontroller: Daisy Seed](https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed)
4. [Amplifier: PAM8302](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2130)
5. [Bluetooth: XIAO nRF52840](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-nRF52840-p-5201.html). It also included Wi-Fi. I haven't checked about the battery management for this one.
6. Battery? Not decided yet.
